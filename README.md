<h1 align="left">Hi, I'm Menna Abu-khadra</h1>

<p align="left">
I'm a Computer Science student who recently started exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  
I’m learning step by step, building small projects, making mistakes, fixing them, and enjoying the process.  
My goal is to become an AI Engineer and eventually work on real-world ML systems that actually make a difference.
